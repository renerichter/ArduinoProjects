# Temperature and Humidity Sensing and Tracking Environment
## Overview and Goal
In our various labs we always have to ensure that the no dust sets on the used components as well as to keep approximately equal temperature and humidity over the whole year. For this an air-conditioning system is installed, but the question arose whether the system is powerful enough to compensate for the high humidity situations in Summer or the low humidity situations in winter. 
For such tracking already a lot of systems, even in the homebuild area, do exist. However, using modern components like a Raspberry PI or an Arduino (here: Uno) this can be build easily by oneself. 

## The used Materials are: 
* Arduino UNO
* Breadboard (Conrad, Nr. 526851)
* Conrad Wires (from Wiring Set, Nr. 526797)
* Conrad Carbon-Film Resistors (from: Carbon-film resistor assortment, 390pcs, Nr. 418706)
* Humidity Sensor HYT-939_FSD (Product Sheets in Materials subfolder)
* Arduino housing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:628929
